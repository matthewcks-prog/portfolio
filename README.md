# Portfolio

I build scalable, reliable software with clean architecture, strong testing habits, and practical product thinking.

## Featured projects

### 1) Lock-in (Flagship)
**What:** Study-focused browser extension + backend services (notes, auth, AI/chat features).  
**Tech:** TypeScript, React, Node.js, Postgres/Supabase, GitHub Actions  
**Highlights:**
- Clean modular architecture (low coupling, clear boundaries)
- Reliability-focused design (validation, error handling, graceful fallbacks)
- Security & privacy hygiene (no secrets in repo, least-privilege patterns)
- Testing + CI quality gates (lint/typecheck/tests)
